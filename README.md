# Vladyslav Kovalov

Welcome to my page, I am a self-taught backend software developer. I have been programming for over 2 years and been mainly focused on learning and understanding the algorithm and data structures. My fundamentals were developed in C++ language, I have extensive understanding of OOP and creation of new data structures, double-pointers are no joke. Currently, I am using Python to quickly develop and deploy programms.
